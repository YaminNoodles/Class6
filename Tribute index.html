 <h2>Bio</h2>
 <p> Man With A Mission is a Japanese Alternative Rock Band formed in 2010 that consists of five members, Tokyo Tanaka (Vocalist), Jean-Ken Johnny (Guitarist & Vocalist), Kamikaze Boy (Bassist & backup vocalist), DJ Santa Monica (Disk Jockey), and Spear Rib (Drummer). They wear wolf masks to represent the Ultimate Life Form as anthropomorphic creatures with high IQ and superhuman strength. Often they are associated with making theme songs for anime, video games, and live acion shows. Their music contains different genres such as hard rock, pop, rap, dance-rock and some punk elements. In most songs they like to switch it up between English and Japanese.</p>

 <p> <q>I got my demons, they don't know
    <br>I'm fierce enough to let them go 
    <br>It's like a fire, a stranglehold 
    <br>I wish I was invincible</q></p>
